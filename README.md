# Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Park Visitation Patterns
## Introduction:
This project aimed to showcase skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization, and Predictive Modeling.

## Assignment Overview:
The task involved analyzing two datasets: weather_data.csv and park_visitation.csv. The goal was to conduct thorough EDA, create insightful visualizations, and develop a predictive model mapping weather data to park visitation. Additional insights were encouraged, along with clear documentation of any assumptions made during the analysis.

## Conclusion:
After performing extensive data cleaning and EDA, significant features were identified using feature engineering techniques such as mutual information regression, SHAP (SHapley Additive explanations), and decision tree regression. A Random Forest algorithm was selected for modeling, resulting in an impressive R-squared score of 83.28%.

## Insights:
The developed model showcases potential applications in predicting visitor numbers for future events or estimating the impact of planned constructions on visitation. This predictive capability is crucial for operational planning and resource allocation in various scenarios.

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements:
To further improve the model's accuracy and applicability, exploring enhancements such as incorporating domain-specific features and experimenting with advanced machine learning algorithms like LightGBM and XGBoost could yield even greater results.
